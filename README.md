# skylab

Skylab is a python based toolkit to perform unbinned likelihood analyses of
spatial clustering on the sphere, commonly used in astroparticle physics.

Documentation of the code can be found in ./doc

This python package provides an interface to do liklelihood maximisation searches
common in neutrino astronomy, but in general extendable to any clustering
search. All the magic happens within the framework of *numpy*, *scipy*, and
*healpy*.
